# Classes

## Defining a class
To define a class:
```java
public class Car {
  // ...
}
```

## Defining Access
Defining access means defining what parts of a class other classes can access/call. You can define access on:
- Instance variables
- Methods
- Constructors
- Classes themselves

### Public
If you declare something as `public`, this means any class can access/call this part of the code. To declare something as public, place the `public` keyword at the start of the declaration/definition/function signature.

### Private
When a instance variable or method is marked as `private`, then these variables/methods can only be accessed/called within the same class.i

## Defining a Constructor
A constructor is a special method defined within the class used to initialize the fields when creating an instance. The constructor must be the same name as class itself. Generally, constructors are defined as `public`.

```java
public class Car {
    public Car() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

A class can have multiple constructors, and they are differentiated based on their parameters. For example
```java
public class Car {
    public String color;
    public int mpg;
    public boolean isElectric;

    public Car(String carColor, int milesPerGallon) {
        color = carColor;
        mpg = milesPerGallon;
    }

    public Car(boolean electricCar, int milesPerGallon) {
        isElectric = electricCar;
        mpg = milesPerGallon;
    }
}
```

When no constructors are defined, the Java compiler creates a default constructor that assigns default values to an instance. Default values can be created by assigning values to the instance fields. For example:
```java
public class Car {
    public String color = "red";

    public main(String[] args) {
        Car ferrari = new Car(); // #=> ferrari.color == "red"
    }
}
```

### Constructor Parameters
To include parameters in a constructor, you can add them like so:
```java
public class Car {
    public String color;

    // Constructor with one parameter: 'carColor'
    public Car(String carColor) {
        color = carColor; // Assign the instance field color to the value of carColor
    }
}
```

## Creating an instance of a class
Using the assignment operator (`=`), you can create a new instance of an object using `new`.
```java
Car ferrari = new Car();
```
Note that the `ferrari` variable is now a referencedata type rather than a primitive. Thus we can use `null` to initialize a reference datatype, therefore it would have a void reference. Itâ€™s important to understand that using a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable will result in a NullPointerException error.

## Adding fields to a class
Fields are characterized by their "has-a" relationship with an object. For example, a car "has-a" color. You can declare fields inside the class outside any methods. Then, these fields will be available in the scope of any method.
```java
public class Car {
    public String color;
    public int year;
    public String modelName;
    public String make;

    public Car() {}
}
```

### Assigning values to instance fields
Fields can be set in three ways:
- If a field is `public`, they can be set like `instanceName.fieldName = someValue;`
- They can be set in class methods
- They can be set in the constructor

## Methods
A method is characterized by its **signature** (name, number of, and parameters of the method). There are two types of parameters: **formal parameters**, and **actual parameters**.
- Formal parameters: variables that will store data that is passed into a method. It specifies the type and name of the data.
- Actual parameters:

When passing arguments, a copy of the argument value is passed to the parameter rather than the actual variables. This is called **call by value**.

### Defining methods

To define a method, you need three things:
1. The visibility (`public`, `private`, etc.)
2. The return type (`void`, `int`, etc.)
3. The name of the method

```java
public void checkBalance() {}
```

### Calling methods
Non-static methods are available to be called on instances of the class.

### Adding parameters
Similar to constructors, parameters are added by including the datatype followed by the parameter name in the method declaration.

#### Method Overloading
Method overloading is possible in Java by creating two methods with the same name, however the method signatures must be different.

### Returning values from methods
You can return a value from a method using the `return` keyword. THis will exit the execution of the method. The value returned must match the return type designated by the methods return type. When returning a primitive datatype, a copy of the value will get returned, which is known as **return by value**. When an object is returned, a **reference** to the object is returned instead of a copy of it.

### Accessor and Mutator Methods
To support encapsulation, we often make our instance variables private. To let other classes access a private instance variable, we write **accessor** methods (also known as getters).
```java
public class Dog {
  private String name;
    
  //Other methods and constructors

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}
```
Private instance variables often have **mutator** methods (also known as setters) which allow other classes to change the stored value in a private instance variable. These methods are often marked as `void` and only have one parameter.

```java
public class Dog {
    private String name;

    pubic void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }
}
```

## The `This` Keyword
The `this` keyword is a reference to the current object. It can be used to get the current objects instance variable, call methods, or passed as a parameter. It is particularly useful when parameters of a method have the same name as an instance variable, so you can use the `this` keyword to specify the instance variable. By default, Java will use the parameter. It is also useful for being more clear about what the thing you are refering to comes from.
```java
public class Computer {
  public int brightness;
  public int volume;
  
  public void setBrightness(int inputBrightness){
    this.brightness = inputBrightness;
  }

  public void setVolume(int inputVolume){
    this.volume = inputVolume;
  }

  public void resetSettings(){
    this.setBrightness(0);
    this.setVolume(0);
  }

  public void pairWithOtherComputer(Computer other){
      // Code for method that uses the parameter other
  }

  public void setUpConnection(){
    // We use "this" to call the method and also pass "this" to the method so it can be used in that method
    this.pairWithOtherComputer(this);
  }
}
```

## Static Methods and Variables
Static methods and variables belong to an entire class, not a specific instance. They can be accessed/called using the class name and the `.` operator. To declare a variable/method as static, add the `static` keyword after the accessiblity keyword.
```java
public class Dog{

  // Static variables
  public static String genus = "Canis";

  //Instance variables
  public int age;
  public String name;

  public Dog(int inputAge, String inputName){
    this.age = inputAge;
    this.name = inputName;
  }

  public static String getGenus() {
    return Dog.genus;
  }
}
```
One important note is that static methods cannot interact with non-staic instance variables.

## Inheritance
To define a child class of another class, we use the `extends` keyword in the class definition:
```java
class Shape {

  // Shape class members

}

class Triangle extends Shape {

  // additional Triangle class members

}
```

### Inheriting Constructors / Methods
To call the constructor of the parent class, we use the `super()` method:
```java
class Triangle extends Shape {

  Triangle() {
    super(3);
  }

  // additional Triangle class members

}
```
Note that you do not need to use the `super()` method. Instead you could initialize all of the parent's class fields in the child's class constructor.

The `super` keyword can also be used to call methods from the parent class. This is useful if we are in a situation where we want to use a base class' method instead of an overridden method.

### Accessibility of Inherited Properites
There are 3 different accessibility keywords that give varying levels of access of the parents class fields:
| Modifier | Class | Package | Child Class | Global |
|----------|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| `public` | YES   | YES     | YES         | YES    |
| `protected` | YES | YES | YES | NO |
| no modifier | YES | YES | NO | NO |
| `private` | YES | NO | NO | NO |

You can use the `protected` keyword as so:
```java
class Shape {

  protected double perimeter;

}
// any child class of Shape can access perimeter
```

You can also use the `final` keyword from changing a method in the parent class.

## Polymorphism

### Method Overriding
To override a method from a parent class in a child class, we need to use the `@Override` annotation. The method name, return type, and number and types of parameters needs to be the same.
```java
class BankAccount {
  protected double balance;

  public BankAccount(double balanceIn){
    balance = balanceIn;
  }

  public void printBalance() {
    System.out.println("Your account balance is $" + balance);
  }
}

class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount {
  
  public CheckingAccount(double balance) {
    super(balance);
  }

  @Override
  public void printBalance() {
    System.out.println("Your checking account balance is $" + balance);
  }
}
```

Note that method overriding is handled at runtime, so if you have call a child override method on an instance of child class that was stored in a parent class variable, the overridden method will be used. However, you cannot use child specific methods, since the compiler things the child is an instance of the parent class.

### Child Classes in Method Parameters
If a method contains a parameter that expects a parent class, you can pass any child classes as arguments.

## Printing Objects
If you were to print an object, you would get something like `Car@6bc7c054`, which is the address of the location in memory where the object is stored. If we wanted to print something more descriptive, we can add a `toString()` method to our class which returns a `String`. This will be printed instead. For example:
```java
class Car {
    String color;

    public Car(String carColor) {
        color = carColor;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car myCar = new Car("red");
        System.out.println(myCar);
    }

   public String toString(){
       return "This is a " + color + " car!";
   }
}
```

## Nested Classes
The process of nesting one class inside another class is known as **encapsulation**.  They allow us to rationally organize and group classes that may be closely related.

There are two types of nested classes: **non-static (inner)** and **static** nested classes. The type of nested class determines whetehr it has access to other elements (static and non-static) within its encapsulating class. 

### Non-Static vs. Static
| Non-Static | Static |
| ---------- | ------ |
| To reference a non-static nested class outside its scope, also need to reference its encompassing class | Only have access to other static members of the encompassing class |
| Have access to both static and non-static members of encompassing class | Can be instantiated independent of an object of their encompasssing class |
| Can only be instantiated after and with reference to an object of its encompassing class | Cannot access any other non-statiuc members of the Java program. |

### Implementing Non-Static Nested Classes
To declare a non-static nested class within an outer class:
```java
class Outer {
  String outer;
  // Assign values using constructor
  public Outer(String name) {
    this.outer = name;
  }

  // private method
  private String getName() {
    return this.outer;
  }
    
  // Non-static nested class
  class Inner {
    String inner;
    String outer;
  }
}
```

To instantiate a non-static nested class:
```java
Outer outer = new Outer();

// Then instantiate inner

Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
```

Below is an example of how a non-static class can access other static and non-static classes from the outer class.
```java
// Non-static nested class
class Inner {
  String inner;
  String outer;
  public String getOuter() {
  // Instantiate outer class to use its method
  outer = Outer.this.getName();
}
```

### Implementing Static Nested Classes
Static nessed classes are helpful because they allow related calsses to be grouped under an enclosing class. To implement a static nested class:
```java
class Toolbox{  
  public static String toolboxName = "Awesome Toolbox";
  public String ownerName;

  static class Saw{
    public void cut(){
      System.out.println("Cutting...");
    }
  }
    
  static class TapeMeasure{
    public void measure(){
      System.out.println("Measuring...");
    }
  }

  static class Wrench{
    public void tighten(){
      System.out.println("Tightening...");
    }

    public void loosen(){
      System.out.println("Loosening...");
    }
  }
}
```
To use a nested class:
```java
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Toolbox.Saw petersSaw = new Toolbox.Saw();
    Toolbox.MeasuringTape amysMeasuringTape = new Toolbox.MeasuringTape();
    Toolbox.Wrench randomWrench = new Toolbox.Wrench();

    petersSaw.cut(); // output: Cutting...
    amysMeasuringTape.measure(); // output: Measuring...
    randomWrench.tighten(); // output: Tightening...
}
```
Static nested classes can access static variables of the enclosing class, but cannot access non-static variables because non-static varibales belong to an instance of the class and not the class itself.

### Shadowing
Shadowing allows for overlapping scoes of members with the same name and type to exist in both a nested class and the enclosing class simultaneously. The value will depend on which object we use to call it. For example:
```java
class Outer {
  String name = "string_1";

  // Nested inner class
  class Inner {
    String name = "string_2";

    public void printTypeMethod() {
      System.out.println(name);
      System.out.println(Outer.this.name);
    }
  }
}

class Main {
  // Main driver method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Outer outerObj = new Outer();
    Outer.Inner innerObj  = outerObj.new Inner();
    innerObj.printTypeMethod();
  }
}
```
This code will output:
```
string_2
string_1
```
